## What Is Solara?

**Solara** is a next-generation Roblox script execution platform engineered for Windows desktop. Unlike browser-based tools, Solara runs natively on Windows 10 and Windows 11, giving you lower injection latency, broader script compatibility, and a session-persistent queue that survives game restarts.

Farm Blox Fruits, auto-hatch Adopt Me pets, dominate Pet Simulator X, or run any custom Lua automation — Solara handles it cleanly without crashes or detection lag.
